# Viewset

Viewset allows us to write the logic for our endpoints. Instead of defining functions (map to HTTP), viewset accept functioons that map to common API object actions.
LIST : for getting a list of objects
CREATE : for creating new objects
RETRIEVE : for getting a specific object
UPDATE : updating an object
PARTIAL UPDATE : for updating part of an object
DESTROY : for deleting an object

Viewsets takes care a lot of typical logic:
- Perfect for writing APIs that performs standard database operation 
- Fastest way to make a database interface with a database backend

When should we use viewset?
1. Need API that performs a simple create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operation on a database model
2. Need a quick and simple API to manage predefined objects
3. Need a very little custom logic additional to the viewsets features already provided by the django rest framework
4. If API is working with a standard data structure
