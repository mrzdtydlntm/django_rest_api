# DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK VIEWS

1. APIView
Is the most type of view we can use to build our API. It enables us describe
the logic which makes our API endpoint. APIView allows us to define functions that
match the standard HTTP methods:
    - HTTP GET: to get one or more items
    - HTTP POST: create an item
    - HTTP PUT: update an item
    - HTTP PATCH: partially update an item
    - HTTP DELETE: delete an item
APIView give us the most control over our application logic:
    - Perfect for implementing complex logic
    - Calling other APIs
    - Working with local files

When to use APIView?
    - Need the full control over the logic, such as when running a very
      complicated algorithm or updating multiple data sources in one API call
      or when you're processing files and rendendering asynchronous response.
    - When calling other external APIs/services in the same request
    - Accessing local files or data
